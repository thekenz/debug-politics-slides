title: The Whole Idea

- Volunteers contributions to GOTV campaigns and other events are valuable.
- We wanted to collect and visualize volunteer data to make the impact of these efforts explicit and sharable.
- We also wanted our platform to be useful to organizers.

<br>
We used:

- surveys of volunteer participation
- campaign expenditures
- and official figures for voter turnout for the 2016 election cycle

to come up with a rough estimate of the value of a volunteer hour.
